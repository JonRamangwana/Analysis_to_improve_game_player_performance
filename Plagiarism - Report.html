What happened to lap 1 had an opposite effect to lap 2.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Slow lap 1 was automatically corrected to produce a fast lap 2.

A sum of 5 completed races of 13 minutes 316 milliseconds.</span><span id="n275" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> ABS caused car to slow down. ABS means Anti-lock braking system. This technology improves safety when emergency breaks are applied.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Breaks won’t lock wheel this prevents any skidding. This technology can be safe at the same time technology slows down a car as seen on this experiment. 4.8</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Fuel consumption switched on When fuel consumption was switched on there was an increase in speed with a decrease in control.<br /><br /></span><span id="n278" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Car handling was not good at high speed, control had to depend on driver skill. Table 12 first row contains race number.</span><span id="n279" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Lap 1 time, lap 2 time, with last column containing race time for five races.

A fast lap time among 5 completed races of 1 minutes 7 seconds 71 milliseconds.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> A sum of 5 completed races of 12 minutes 34 seconds 816 milliseconds. Fuel consumption means there was a decrease in petrol when car was moving.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This happens in real life. When a car gets a decrease in petrol, weight decreases. Small weight makes a car move fast, an engine has small weight to carry.<br /><br /></span><span id="n294" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This was a reason for a big increase in speed when fuel consumption was switched on. 4.9</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Tyre wear switched on Lap 2 was difficult to drive when tyre wear was switched on. This configuration increased speed at the same time.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Table 14 first row contains race number.

This would make tyres slippery with time.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Lap 2 was difficult to drive tyres had lost grip they had at the beginning at the same time an increase in speed was seen when tyre wear switched on.<br /><br /></span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This increase in speed was difficult to explain since no grip means decrease in control. There can be 2 reasons for increase in speed.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> First reason can be a decrease in friction this can increase straight line speed. Grip gets needed for speed at corners.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Second reason can be decrease in weight as the tyres wear this might increase speed. 4.10</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Slipstream switched on When slipstream was switched on there was a small increase in speed with a decrease in control. Table 16 first row contains race number.<br /><br /></span><span id="n318" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Lap 1 time, lap 2 time, with last column containing race time for five races.

Slipstream causes low pressure in the back of a moving car.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Any car moving behind another fast moving car can experience low drag. When drag gets low a car can move fast because nothing opposes its movement. 4.11</span><span id="n333" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Race time percentage There was no mechanical damage on chart 1. Mechanical damage was removed from analysis. Sum of 5 race times for each variable was calculated.<br /><br /></span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> These sums were converted to percentages of time that this game was played. Table 18 first column has variables.

Stability control had a time percentage of 13% on pie chart.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This was similar to time percentage when each variable was switched off meaning there was no improvement to game player performance.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Stability control was not necessary to improve game player performance. Slipstream, tyre wear, fuel consumption, ABS, tyre blankets etc.<br /><br /></span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> each had a 12% race time percentage. An improvement to 13% when each variable was switched off. When racing small time differences matter.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> A race can get won by a few milliseconds. This fact makes further analysis necessary. 4.12</span><span id="n344" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Average race time Anova When Anova hypothesis test was done H1 was desired to be certain that there were race time differences when variables changed.</span><span id="n345" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This shows how important each variable was to this experiment. Table 19 has 5 columns with numbers. To reject H0 three values on table 19 had to get looked at.<br /><br /></span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> First value was p value this was 0.02176.

Traction control was slow compared to when each variable was off.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Stability control has a bar similar to when each variable was off. Tyre blankets, ABS, fuel consumption, tyre wear, slipstream etc.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> had short bar graphs compared to when each variable was off. These results show that traction control need to get switched off when racing.<br /><br /></span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Stability control improved nothing. Fuel consumption caused a big improvement, followed by tyre blankets, tyre wear, ABS then slipstream respectively.</span><span id="n355" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Graph 19 shows a bar graph for fast lap time.

Conclusion Assetto Corsa was proved to be a true racing simulator. Car drives like a real life car.<br /><br /></span><span id="n359" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Winning was difficult because racing can get difficult in real life.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Traction control, mechanical damage, stability control were switched off to switch on 5 remaining variables that improved game player performance.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> When game was played with this configuration, races were won. At the moment these experiments were completed stage 2 of the game had been unlocked.</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This analysis improved game player performance.<br /><br /></span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Wonder of analysis, numbers became visualizations, visualizations became conclusions, decisions were made that improved game player’s performance. 6.</span><span id="n364" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Recommendations Winning this game requires a few simple steps that were tested by this experiment.</span><span id="n365" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> These steps are to: switch off traction control switch off stability control switch off mechanical damage turn sharp corners with gear number 2 avoid crashing practice</span><span id="n0" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> driving skills Simple steps with a big difference. 7.
